# Feast On Beast

<h3>Initial Outlook</h3>

Feast On Beast is an interactive web application that will serve as a source of information for anyone interested in hunting, or the outdoors. Will also host media options such as pictures, and videos that I will upload for the viewers entertainment.  The web application will also host recipes for cooking wild game meats, and vegetation for all levels of expertise/diets. The main purpose of this web app is to educate the masses the importance of wild life conservation, and hopefully influence others to take action towards helping save the environment. The secondary purpose is to allow those who may not be able to hunt, or go out in the true outdoors the opportunity to read about my experiences and in a sense live through it.
